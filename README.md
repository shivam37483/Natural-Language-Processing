# Restaurant-Reviews-Predictor

Our aim is to conduct sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews provided by 1000 customers, determining whether they express a positive or negative sentiment.

This will be achieved through the training of our model using Natural Language Processing techniques applied to the extensive dataset of customer reviews.
